Title: App Logging Made a Little Easier
Description: Mostly my attempt at learning R combined with my take on logging
    timed events during code execution.  Since I found the result useful I 
    figured I would also try learning how to package things in R so that I 
    might be able to reuse the usefulness in other code without resorting to 
    monkey-VyP methodologies.
